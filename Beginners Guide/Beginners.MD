[CHAOSS community](https://chaoss.community) is a Linux Foundation project focused on creating analytics and metrics to help define community health.
Our website [CHAOSS community](https://chaoss.community) is a WordPress website and the WordPress site is created directly from Markdown on our GitHub account.  

### Contents of this repository

So to make changes to any part of the [About](https://chaoss.community/about/) page, you can check the contents of the [About](https://github.com/chaoss/website/tree/master/About) Folder and make any change.
