_Postdoc in Software Engineering - University of Mons, Belgium_

[@a_zerou](https://twitter.com/a_zerou)

Ahmed finished his PhD in Science in 2019 from the University of Mons. He is currently working within the SECO-ASSIST project (https://secoassist.github.io) as a postdoctoral researcher from the UMONS. His research focuses on the evolution, health and analysis of open source software ecosystems. 

<details><summary><b>Session: Technical Lag: Measuring the outdatedness, vulnerability and bugginess of software</b></summary>

This talk presents a generic and empirically validated measurement framework based on the technical lag concept. The framework can be used to assess and reduce the outdatedness, vulnerability and bugginess of software deployments, software projects, software containers and reusable software libraries. We argue that such a metric is very relevant for assessing the health of software (eco)systems, and should become part of the CHAOSS metrics portfolio and tooling. The concept of technical lag aims to quantify to which extent a deployed collection of components is outdated with respect to an ideal deployment. How to interpret this ""ideal"" and the ""outdatedness"" w.r.t. this ""ideal"" is highly context-specific. Depending on the needs and goals of a specific project or a maintainer, the focus may be on functionality, security, stability or even other factors. The ""components"" under consideration could be individual software packages, third-party libraries, component dependencies, or software containers bundling collections of components. To cover this high variability, we have come up with a generic framework for technical lag. We have operationalised and empirically validated this framework in different contexts: to assess the technical lag incurred by outdated dependencies in reusable package repositories such as npm; and to quantify the outdatedness of Debian-based Docker containers in terms of missing updates, vulnerabilities and bugs. We also report on the qualitative evaluation of the usefulness of measuring technical lag, through online surveys conducted with open source software developers. Finally, we present Conpan, an open source tool that we have developed for analysing technical lag in Docker containers. Useful references about technical lag are available on https://secoassist.github.io/results.html

He has also a Ph.D. in Artificial Intelligence related to web page representation by means of fuzzy logic oriented to clustering tasks. 

<details><summary><b>Session: Managing community backlog with the help of metrics</b></summary>

One of the ways you can measure responsiveness to community contribution is by looking at the size of the backlog periodically. If the backlog of community contribution keeps growing without contributions being closed/merged in a timely manner, this will lead to dissatisfaction among community members. In this talk, Ray will discuss why “Community contribution” Merge Request (MR) backlog has become important at GitLab and how he worked with Alberto at Bitergia to develop visualizations for MR backlogs across GitLab projects. Alberto will discuss why current GrimoireLab dashboards needed to evolve to support GitLab’s use case (beyond GrimoireLab’s existing backlog focused dashboards), technical challenges and limitations when developing the visualization (e.g. calculating the number of contributions that were in opened state on the fly within a given time range that can be selected by the user), and plans for upstreaming this work to CHAOSS.

Camille has been an Open Source and Open Standards advocate for quite a few years now; he is currently working as a consultant at Inno³, a French niche consultancy specialized in all things Open from an IP & organisational point of view. 

<details><summary><b>Session: Metrics and valuation of open source projects: A crossover between Open Source and Open Science </b></summary>

Despite the evolution of the legal context (at European and national levels) to acknowledge and leverage the benefits of Open Source, Open Data and Open Science - especially in regards to innovation - the most commonly used metrics to evaluate the potential and the success of projects are still tied to old & closed Intellectual Property practices (number of patents, direct financial streams from proprietary licencing, etc.). There is a need for metrics more suited to fairly arbitrate between an open or a closed model and also to more efficiently manage open projects’ valorisation.
This session will present our explorations for a methodology to reflect the value generated by Open Source projects in the field of public research. We will build on our work in an open working group dedicated to the valuation of open intangible assets and studies we have conducted for public institutions, including the French Space Agency (CNES). It will cover theoretical questions like the definition of value in a given context as well as down-to-earth implementation-specific problems, like choosing micro-metrics for code contribution.
The presentation will also highlight how current research in academia on the evaluation of open science (good citation practices, tracability and reproducibility) can be a source of inspiration for further work in open source communities.

<details><summary><b>Session:  Emerging Tech Open-Source Scoring System (ETOSS)</b></summary>

This is a framework used by the UNICEF Innovation Fund, to evaluate and track the strategic position and growth potential of the early stage startups in its portfolio. The focus is on startups building open source frontier tech: Blockchain, Data Science, Artificial Intelligence and Extended Reality. It classifies the startups into four quadrants, based on two dimensions: the software developed (technology), and the financial sustainability of the project (business sustainability).

Essentially, each startup gets a final scoring for each of the two dimensions that helps position them in a matrix-kind of graph. When placed in the top right corner of the graph, the startup would have a high level of development in both dimensions. The final scoring is calculated through the weighted average of the score given to a series of key performance indicators depending on how strong they are. In the case of the ‘technology’ dimension, the calculation includes: GitHub Code Activity (Stars, forks, Commits, Contributors, Pull requests, Issues Tracking); Code Test Coverage; Open Source License Status; User Testing #; Prototype Readiness. In the case of the ‘business sustainability’ dimension, the calculation includes: Revenue, Expenses; Profit Margin; Number of Users and User Growth; Amount of funding received and number of third party funders (aside from them and UNICEF); Team sustainability (including tech and business skills as well as gender diversity).

<details><summary><b>Session: CHA-IO-SS - Community Health Analytics for Inner and Open Source Software</b></summary>

CHAOSS has been on the ground for the last couple of years with a strong focus on open source. Indeed at the very beginning there was some discussion to have included in the mission and vision of the community the term InnerSource that was lately removed. What if we think for a while about InnerSource in the terms of metrics? As active member of the InnerSource Commons, it is worth mentioning a list of them and how behaviours that are assumed by default in open source communities (collaboration, transparency, communication) do not even exist at the InnerSource level. This talk aims at fostering some discussion internally at CHAOSS with the purpose of understanding InnerSource requirements and how with the same infrastructure, metrics and discussions we're having, CHAOSS may become at some point some standard in the industry about software development metrics (and not only open source software development metrics).

<details><summary><b>Keynote: Ethics: What You Know & What You Don't Know</b></summary>

Metrics give us a lot of insight into what's going on with our projects -- but only if we have enough context. The catch is that personal biases and pre-conceptions are extremely hard to filter for so no one person can see everything. Those gaps means that even the most well-meaning of us could end up doing more harm than good. In this talk, I'll share a few examples of the ways human brains make assumptions, some of our typical blind spots and how incomplete data can cause harm when deployed without any checks. For folks who collect, analyze and ultimately make mission critical decisions with metrics, the challenge is to constantly maintain a bit of healthy skepticism of what the numbers seem to be telling us.

And we can say one thing definitively - Hacktoberfest participation can be a powerful catalyst for your community of free and open source software contributors.

This talk will present an overview of the metrics we collected from two years of Hacktoberfest participation. We will present the metrics against the backdrop of contribution activity through the year.

We will present:
an overview of the metrics we collect about contribution activity 
metrics for contribution activity from two years of Hacktoberfest;
overall contribution metrics from the months when Hacktoberfest was not running;
the lessons we learned from encouraging participation in the event;
how we kept Hacktoberfest participants engaged after the event; 

This talk is for anyone who is interested in driving Hacktoberfest participation in their own company, or who is looking for a way to jumpstart open source participation in their community.

<details><summary><b>Session: Language barriers for open source contributors</b></summary>

While open source development is common across the world, projects from countries outside North America and Europe, such as China, have difficulties attracting international contributors. One major reason for this is language differences. Thus, there is a lack of understanding of whether there are problems with attraction and retention of contributors due to language differences. To address the aforementioned issue, the proposed presentation will provide an overview of the diversity of non-native English speakers in different open source ecosystems. Furthermore, we will provide results about whether or not those contributors face a language barrier when contributing to open source projects. This will include a survey and a discussion with the audience to understand their motivations when contributing to open source projects, if they have ever faced any communication problems due to language differences, if the non-native English speakers feel welcomed in open source communities, and if they have ever felt that there is a language barrier when contributing to open source projects. The presentation will conclude with a discussion on how we can create metrics to assess the spoken language diversity in open source communities and how to include those people in the community more easily.

<details><summary><b>Session: Navigating Community Health Through Comparison</b></summary>

In this presentation, we share stories from 30 plus interviews on community health and offer our insights from engagement with the CHAOSS project. In particular, we focus on how people use comparisons in the determination of project health. To make solutions actionable, placing open source project metrics into the specific contexts where they are consumed is critical. When open source project contributors compare one open source project to another, they get a sense of how they are doing, relatively speaking. The comparison is social insofar as people draw comparisons between projects that are similar in terms of personnel or other key characteristics; projects they are socially familiar with. Through comparison, open source project contributors identify metrics that draw essential contrasts, and through these contrasts evaluate the likelihood of continued success or failure for their projects of interest.

<details><summary><b>Session: Metrics are more than the sum of their parts</b></summary>

There was a time in human history when it was believed that all of human behavior could be explained with math. That widely acclaimed and highly respected science was disproved by an “incompleteness theorem” that showed math cannot explain the world on its own. In another time in human history, psychologists believed all human behavior could be reduced to cause and effect. This gave rise to Gestalt theory that shows perception is not always mapped cleanly or with certainty. We are in a state of Community building that maps success to metrics like lines of code and GitHub stars. I would like us to explore where these metrics fall short on capturing the most significant value of a community, and how we can use other metrics to begin to show the much larger impact Community organizations like Developer Relations (DevRel) can have on a business. This improved process begins with mapping value to business need, pairing it with a community need, and back to the business opportunities. If you enjoy a little science, a lot of community metrics, and are looking for new ways to show a business the value of your community efforts, this talk is for you. There will be practical advice on how to pitch and position Community whether you’re a Community Manager, Developer Advocate, or other Developer Relations professional.

<details><summary><b>Session: Diversity & Inclusion Badging Program</b></summary>

The Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that employees in the field of “computer and mathematical occupations” are 25.6% female (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2019). A lack of D&I is not only a known problem but also acts as a barrier for potential contributors becoming involved with IT as a lack of D&I will perpetuate complacency (Irwin, 2018), avoidance (Sterling, 2016), and a negative collective conscience (Blincoe et al., 2019). Within IT, open source software exhibits some of the worst D&I. The open source survey run by GitHub states that only 3% of contributors to open source software are female (GitHub, 2017). While open source has made strides in some aspects of D&I, such as event inclusivity (Irwin, 2017) and community engagement to support organizational diversity (Alexander, 2019), work remains. The proposed is aimed at contributing to this positive growth through the development of a D&I badging system. In open source, badges are available for community leaders to publicly display, providing a way for projects to signal their attention to such things as community health and software security. Known examples of software badging systems in open source include the CII Best Practices Badge, Black Duck Security Risk Badge, and the PyPi Python Coverage Badge. We can draw from this badging work to improve D&I in open source. While software badges present solutions for most goals of software development, no badge has been created to support D&I initiatives, and the proposed talk aims to advance these efforts. In this talk, I will discuss complexities associated with D&I metrics and propose a D&I badging system that provides open source communities the ability to make diversity and inclusion within open source projects more transparent.

<details><summary><b>Session: Managing community backlog with the help of metrics</b></summary>

One of the ways you can measure responsiveness to community contribution is by looking at the size of the backlog periodically. If the backlog of community contribution keeps growing without contributions being closed/merged in a timely manner, this will lead to dissatisfaction among community members. In this talk, Ray will discuss why “Community contribution” Merge Request (MR) backlog has become important at GitLab and how he worked with Alberto at Bitergia to develop visualizations for MR backlogs across GitLab projects. Alberto will discuss why current GrimoireLab dashboards needed to evolve to support GitLab’s use case (beyond GrimoireLab’s existing backlog focused dashboards), technical challenges and limitations when developing the visualization (e.g. calculating the number of contributions that were in opened state on the fly within a given time range that can be selected by the user), and plans for upstreaming this work to CHAOSS.

Making it simple to trust, ship, and grow open source at Twitter demanded visibility into contribution trends that were not readily available. Twitter's open source program office and the Augur project collaborated with CHAOSS using student interns from Google's Summer of Code, Twitter's intern program and the University of Missouri. First, this talk will describe Twitter's engaging interface design and its fit to the needs of Open Source stakeholders within Twitter, but outside the open source program office. Second, we will describe how an open API and data collection tool, Augur, evolved in close collaboration with Twitter.

<details><summary><b>Session: Measuring Culture</b></summary>

They say you can’t be certain of anything unless it can be measured – so what about culture? We know it exists and can be passed on to others, so there must be a way to measure it. Using Apache Kibble we attempt to look for cultural indicators at the Apache Software Foundation, set a cultural benchmark then match real Apache projects against it. In theory we would expect a perfect match but as the results show, culture isn’t that simple.

<details><summary><b>Session: Technical Lag: Measuring the outdatedness, vulnerability and bugginess of software</b></summary>

This talk presents a generic and empirically validated measurement framework based on the technical lag concept. The framework can be used to assess and reduce the outdatedness, vulnerability and bugginess of software deployments, software projects, software containers and reusable software libraries. We argue that such a metric is very relevant for assessing the health of software (eco)systems, and should become part of the CHAOSS metrics portfolio and tooling. The concept of technical lag aims to quantify to which extent a deployed collection of components is outdated with respect to an ideal deployment. How to interpret this ""ideal"" and the ""outdatedness"" w.r.t. this ""ideal"" is highly context-specific. Depending on the needs and goals of a specific project or a maintainer, the focus may be on functionality, security, stability or even other factors. The ""components"" under consideration could be individual software packages, third-party libraries, component dependencies, or software containers bundling collections of components. To cover this high variability, we have come up with a generic framework for technical lag. We have operationalised and empirically validated this framework in different contexts: to assess the technical lag incurred by outdated dependencies in reusable package repositories such as npm; and to quantify the outdatedness of Debian-based Docker containers in terms of missing updates, vulnerabilities and bugs. We also report on the qualitative evaluation of the usefulness of measuring technical lag, through online surveys conducted with open source software developers. Finally, we present Conpan, an open source tool that we have developed for analysing technical lag in Docker containers. Useful references about technical lag are available on https://secoassist.github.io/results.html

<details><summary><b>Session: Open and Reproducible Research with Community-driven Research Software Metrics</b></summary>

What do artificial neural networks, images of the black hole, and SETI@home all have in common? They all trace their roots to research software. In this session, we hope to explore metrics and best practices for evaluating open research software. Research software engineers are evaluated largely based on the numbers of publications and citations. However, metrics based on the number of publications encourage re-creating ‘new’ things or reimplementations instead of reuse, and there are huge variations in existing practices to cite software, meaning software isn't always cited or citations aren’t always captured. Better metrics that reflect the health of research software is crucial to avoid gamification, incentivising research software engineers to follow best software development practices by recognising and rewarding their effort appropriately, and ultimately advancing open science and improving the reproducibility of research. 

Through engaging the audience in a discussion to compare research software and other FOSS, we hope to better connect the research software community to the wider FOSS community. By learning from each other, we aim to identify evaluation metrics that accurately reflect research software health and can be used by hiring committees and research funders, to encourage them to move away from current problematic metrics. Ultimately, we hope this will incentivise the creation and maintenance of good quality scientific open software.
